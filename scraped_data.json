Non-removable stickers, scratches everywhere, and shameful packaging with nothing more than the battery and a twisted up cable. I\u2019ve purchased many Anker products but lately things have really gone down in quality. Had to return two chargers I received when what I ordered were cables. Now I have to return this previously used item. You may want to consider another brand.\n\nUPDATE: Some time later Anker reached out to me regarding the situation and sent me a free replacement. Despite the initial disappointment, I appreciate them working to make it right."

I share them with my family and use all 4."

While playing with the anker power core i noticed my battery dropped to 63%. It wasnt on trickle charge. I turned off the quest for an hour to let the anker charge it up and it only gained 1%. Ill be returning this canker anker."
